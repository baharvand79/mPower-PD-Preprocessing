    "# mPower Data Filtering and Cleaning\n",
    "The criteria is based on the ***\"Pre-trained convolutional neural\n",
    "networks identify Parkinson’s\n",
    "disease from spectrogram images\n",
    "of voice samples\"***[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92105-6] paper.\n",
    "## Notebook Objective\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to load the raw mPower participant data, merge the demographic and recording information, and systematically apply a series of filtering criteria to produce a clean dataset ready for analysis. The criteria are designed to isolate a specific cohort of People with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD) and Healthy Controls (HC) based on age, health history, and medication status.\n",
    "## Summary of Criteria\n",
    "1. Groups: PwPD (professional diagnosis = TRUE) and HC (professional diagnosis = FALSE).\n",
    "2. Age: 50–70 years old.\n",
    "3. Health Exclusions: No self-reported diagnosis of Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Asthma, Stroke, or COPD.\n",
    "4. Consistency:\n",
    "    - PwPD must report taking PD medication.\n",
    "    - HC must report not taking PD medication.\n",
    "5. - PwPD Medication Timing: Only include recordings taken 'Immediately before Parkinson medication' or at 'Another time'. Exclude the \"ON\" state ('Just after Parkinson medication').\n",
    "    - PwPD DBS: No DBS!\n",
    "6. Final Cohort: One unique, high-quality recording per subject.\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "### Step 1: Setup and Data Loading\n",
    "**Reasoning:** We begin by importing the necessary libraries (pandas for data manipulation, os for handling file paths) and loading the two separate CSV files. demographic_info.csv contains participant-level data like age and health history, while info.csv contains recording-specific data like medication timing. We need both to apply all the criteria."
